<h1 class="w">What is a Worldview?</h1> 
<p class="p">Simply put, a worldview is the way we see the world or how we make sense of the 
world around us. Everyone has a worldview whether they understand what it is. It's 
shaped by our families, friends, faith, culture, media, circumstances, and a host 
of other influences.</p>
<p class="p">What defines our own personal worldview is how we answer the following questions 
in these four categories - (1) Creation: Where did we come from and who are we?, 
(2) The Fall: What has gone wrong with the world?, (3) Redemption: What can we do 
to fix it?, and (4) Restoration: How now shall we live? </p>
<p class="p">Regardless of your age, sex, profession, nationality, faith (or lack of), 
family background or education, everyone has thought or will think about these four 
questions in some sort of fashion because we are trying to make sense of the world 
around us, i.e. our worldview.</p>
<p class="p">There are several ways to distinguish one worldview from another. In 
his acclaimed book, Understanding the Times, Dr. David A. Noebel, helps define and 
leads the way for public discussion of religious worldview variations. He presents 
four major religious worldviews: Secular Humanism, Marxist/Leninist Humanism, Cosmic 
Humanism (New Age) and Biblical Christianity . Since the book's original publication, 
Dr. Noebel has added Postmodernism and Islam to the list. Each worldview perceives the 
world by addressing ten systems of thought: theology, philosophy, ethics, science, 
psychology, sociology, law, politics, economics and history. What one thinks and
believes about the world defines which worldview he or she has. 
(see <a href="http://www.summit.org/resources/worldview_chart/">Worldview Chart</a>) </p>
<p class="p">The Law of Non-Contradiction states that two conflicting ideas cannot 
be true at the same time, at the same place, under the same circumstances. For example, 
if one is discussing the origin of the universe, it was either created (supernaturalism) 
or it was not created (naturalism); either it occurred one way or the other. However, 
it cannot have happened both ways. Because one of these ideas (supernaturalism or 
naturalism) must be false, so must be the worldview that holds the false idea as a 
system of thought. </p>
<p class="p">There's a battle being waged on every man, woman and child who seeks 
the truth. In his book, Children At Risk, Dr. James Dobson says, "Nothing short of 
a great Civil War of Values rages today throughout North America, Two sides with 
vastly differing and incompatible worldviews are locked in a bitter conflict that 
permeates every level of society…Instead of fighting for territory or military 
conquest, however, the struggle now is for the hearts and minds of the people. 
It is a war over ideas. And someday soon, I believe, a winner will emerge and the 
loser will fade from memory. For now, the outcome is very much in doubt."  
Important point - Ideas have consequences. </p>
