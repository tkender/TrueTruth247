<h1>Mission Statement</h1>

<div style="width:70%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;padding:2px;border:solid 1px grey;">
<p>
As Christians in the Body of Christ, we believe God expects us to set our sights 
toward Heaven by His grace and gift of salvation through His Son Jesus Christ. 
We believe our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against those entities 
influenced by spiritual forces of evil, i.e. Satan. For this reason, we accept the 
challenge to educate ourselves and others of worldly issues which have an impact on Christians. 
We do this by the help of the Holy Spirit, and we give all honor and glory to God.
