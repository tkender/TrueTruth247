<h1>What We Believe</h1>

<h3>Our purpose</h3>

<div style="width:70%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;padding:2px;border:solid 1px grey;">
<p>This website is a ministry of Plainfield Christian Church located in Plainfield., Indiana. Plainfield Christian Church is a congregation that is built on Jesus Christ as its head and the authority of the Word of God.</p>

<p>We understand our charge is to love God with all that we are (Mark 12:29-30) and to love others to Jesus Christ (Mark 12:31).</p>

<p>We are part of a worldwide movement that is devoted to restoring the church to New Testament principles.</p>

<p>To enter the Kingdom of God we teach what has been outlined in Scripture:</p>
<ol>
<li>Faith in Jesus as the Son of God (Matthew 16:16)</li>
<li>Repentance of sin (Luke 13:3)</li>
<li>Confession of Christ (Romans 10:9)</li>
<li>Baptism by immersion (Acts 2:38)</li>
</ol>

<p>As we receive God's free gift of salvation, we make it our life goal to become like our Lord Jesus Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>We do not claim to be the only Christians, but Christians only.</p>
